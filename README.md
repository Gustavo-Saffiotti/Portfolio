## Projects Overview

### [Project 1: Data Analytics - Higher Education in Brazil in 2020](https://github.com/Gustavo-Saffiotti/Data_Analytics)

![](Images/Region.jpg)



This project analyzes the landscape of public higher education in Brazil for the year 2020. It utilizes data from the National Institute of Educational Studies and Research Anísio Teixeira (Inep). The project covers multiple stages, including data collection, cleaning, preparation, and interactive visualization through Power BI.

#### Key Highlights:
- **Tools Used**: Microsoft Excel, Power BI, DAX (Data Analysis Expressions).
- **Key Insights**: The analysis provides a detailed breakdown of undergraduate student profiles, the distribution of students across regions, and the variety of courses offered by different institutions.

### [Project 2: Data Science - Vehicle Price Prediction using Machine Learning](https://github.com/Gustavo-Saffiotti/Data_Science)

![](Images/Result.png)

This project uses machine learning to predict the average price of vehicles based on various features such as engine size, fuel type, and vehicle brand. The model was built using **Random Forest Regressor** and optimized through **RandomizedSearchCV** for hyperparameter tuning.

#### Key Highlights:
- **Tools Used**: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy.
- **Model Performance**: The model performs excellently with high R², meaning it explains almost all the variance in vehicle price predictions.

#### Model Evaluation:
- **MAE**: 4659.15
- **MSE**: 151,821,780.30
- **RMSE**: 12,321.60
- **R²**: 1.00
- 

### [Project 3: SQL Files Repository](https://github.com/Gustavo-Saffiotti/SQL_Files)

![](Images/SQL_structure.png)

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of SQL scripts, showcasing the full range of SQL capabilities. It includes examples of:

- **DDL**: Creating and managing database schemas, tables, and relationships.
- **DML**: Querying and manipulating data, including complex `SELECT` queries.
- **DCL**: Managing permissions and user access.
- **TCL**: Handling transactions and ensuring database integrity.
- **Stored Procedures & Triggers**: Automating database tasks and handling database events.

These scripts are designed to demonstrate advanced SQL functionality and serve as learning material for anyone looking to deepen their SQL expertise.

## [Additional Project: Mechanical Engineering - Vibration Analysis](https://github.com/Gustavo-Saffiotti/Vibration-Analysis)

![](Images/spectrum.jpg)

This project includes an article I authored on Vibration Analysis, an essential field within mechanical engineering. The study focuses on the **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)** method, widely used to identify and analyze frequency components in rotating machinery systems.

My foundational knowledge in vibration analysis directly contributed to my work at General Motors, where I applied these concepts in a vibration monitoring project as part of a maintenance initiative aimed at predicting failures. This project achieved significant cost reductions by enabling early detection of mechanical issues through effective vibration monitoring.
