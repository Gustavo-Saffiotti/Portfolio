# Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! Here, I showcase some of my completed projects: one analyzing the higher education landscape in Brazil in 2020, and the other predicting vehicle prices using Machine Learning. These projects demonstrate my skills in Data Analytics, Data Science, Machine Learning, and data visualization.

## Projects Overview

### [Project 1: Data Analytics - Higher Education in Brazil in 2020](https://github.com/Gustavo-Saffiotti/Data_Analytics)

This project analyzes the landscape of public higher education in Brazil for the year 2020. It utilizes data from the National Institute of Educational Studies and Research Anísio Teixeira (Inep). The project covers multiple stages, including data collection, cleaning, preparation, and interactive visualization through Power BI.

#### Key Highlights:
- **Tools Used**: Microsoft Excel, Power BI, DAX (Data Analysis Expressions).
- **Key Insights**: The analysis provides a detailed breakdown of undergraduate student profiles, the distribution of students across regions, and the variety of courses offered by different institutions.

### [Project 2: Data Science - Vehicle Price Prediction using Machine Learning](https://github.com/Gustavo-Saffiotti/Data_Science)


This project uses machine learning to predict the average price of vehicles based on various features such as engine size, fuel type, and vehicle brand. The model was built using **Random Forest Regressor** and optimized through **RandomizedSearchCV** for hyperparameter tuning.

#### Key Highlights:
- **Tools Used**: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy.
- **Model Performance**: The model performs excellently with high R², meaning it explains almost all the variance in vehicle price predictions.

#### Model Evaluation:
- **MAE**: 4659.15
- **MSE**: 151,821,780.30
- **RMSE**: 12,321.60
- **R²**: 1.00

## Additional Project: Mechanical Engineering - Vibration Analysis

During my internship at General Motors, I conducted an in-depth vibration analysis to support an engine maintenance project. This work was critical in reducing maintenance costs and optimizing engine longevity, resulting in significant cost savings for the company.(https://github.com/Gustavo-Saffiotti).
